I have been trapesing through a bunch of summarized readings and explanations of design patterns. All I could think about is how it makes understanding object-oriented programming easier and harder at the same time. Easier in that if the code fits the scenario, then why not utilize an already thought-up pattern. However, it is not needed for every scenario, and it is possible to fall into the trap of using design patterns to overcomplicate code. That is where the hard part comes in. Design patterns are generalized patterns to a solution. They are not the key to solve all problems. It is good to know that there may already be an object-oriented structure out there that could fit a program, but really, it is a bit of an afterthought.
I feel like it is something that should be learned, but
