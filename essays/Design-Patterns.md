I have been trapesing through a bunch of summarized readings and explanations of design patterns. All I can say is I still do not understand design patterns. Do not get me wrong. I understand that design patterns are a hashed-out reusable object-oriented concept not entirely to simplify but also to adapt object code for multiple instances. Everyone uses the word “solution.” I think it is because of the GOF OG book, but solutions make design patterns sound like a fixer or a bandaid and not an applied concepts concept.

I understand that design patterns are hard and have a more significant “real-world” application than algorithms. However, it will take me significantly more time to digest and integrate design patterns into my code style than object-oriented programming(oop). In many of these summarized readings, the recurring theme that everyone warns about is simplicity. Looking beyond the fundamental warning of keeping your code simple. Which I think is one of the biggest traps of design patterns. I am positive it is easy to mistake making multiple classes in an attempt at design patterns instead of just some classes with numerous methods. The religious use of simplicity makes me wonder if design patterns are not just a technique to connect multiple simple codes in such a way to conform to most challenges.

One of the readings talks about using design patterns and standardizing the program when multiple people work on the same project. After this revelation, my team and I could benefit from this in our project. Right now, we are just adding more and more collections to the mongo database. Currently, we have a still-growing page of subscriptions and publications that I feel could be simplified and optimized by utilizing design patterns. Sadly I do not know just yet what design pattern would be best suited for this task, but surely there must be a better way to simplify the current 12(and still growing) subscriptions and publication methods for an application with a fraction of the pages.
