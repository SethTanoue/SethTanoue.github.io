    I wished I learned about JavaScript when I first started coding. I know that JavaScript, like all programming languages, has its caveats, but after using JavaScript, I only have one problem. Many years ago, early in my college career, I had the unfortunate speed bump of learning C++. It was for an Engineering course I was taking at the time, and this class was the first programming class I have ever taken. It was a 101 class, and after countless hours of frustration, I barely passed the course. As a result, it left me scared. I had tried to avoid as much programming that I could.
    
    Years later, a counselor suggested taking a Python class I needed another Computer Science credit and told me it is easier than C++. I request, and she was right; Python was easier. However, while learning Python, I noticed that Python was more manageable due to its relaxed syntax. Looking back now, I can only remember a strict adherence to coding guidelines from that C++ class. The forgiveness of Python or JavaScript, for that matter, makes coding a lot more enjoyable. JavaScript has fantastic and easy-to-use functions, variables, objects, and my favorite, typecasting. The ease of access is nothing st scoff at because all you need is a browser. If my professor showed me JavaScript earlier, I probably would have gotten into coding a lot sooner.
    
    Having said how much I enjoy JavaScript, I do have one primary concern over it. That concern is bad habits. JavaScript has terrific features that give the user easy use of functions, variables, and objects without worrying about return types, function types, or variable type. You can create a function that could take in an array of integers, calculate the sum of the array and return either an integer or string in just a few lines of code. If you told me that this was possible when I was learning C++, I would have laughed at you. However, I worry I will attempt to use it in another coding language because of this feature. To add more fuel to the fire, JavaScript is very forgiving on syntax. Syntax errors are the most common errors in any coding language, especially the infamous semicolon. With JavaScript, semicolons become optional.
    
    My problem of bad habits is only a minor problem, and all it takes is a couple of weeks to break out of. JavaScript is a wonderful programming language and should be used more widely, especially with those interested in programming. Sure, these people will develop bad habits in coding. Still, I think that outweighs the potential of what could happen if new prospective programmers had a taste of the vast world of programming without being bogged down by language restrictions. At the crux of things, a programmer is a problem fixer.  We are using challenge problems found in interview questions, WODs from class and online to cultivate and exercise our knowledge. Add on the fact that these challenges are just plain good brain exercises. I think the programming community would grow significantly more if we used these coding challenge problems to entice prospective programmers without instantly throwing them to the wolves. Instead, we should slowly introduce the unfortunate world of compilers, datatypes, and syntax.
