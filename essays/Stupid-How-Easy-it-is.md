HTML and CSS became a lot easier once we started to learn UI Framework. I remember the frustrations I went through when I first learned HTML back in Middle school cerca 2006. Honestly, learning the language was not all that hard, but I remember the frustrations and hours I went through to make a web page. Worst it looked like it came straight out of the ’90s. It looked terrible. It was blocky, the header and menu were awkward, and I think I had a table in there so I could have three columns and not have to readjust for different window sizes. Unfortunately, that abomination has been sealed, destroyed, and recycled in my family’s old computer, never to be seen again.

 That being said, I could now probably whip out that same web page in an hour or so now. Probably take even less time since learning Semantic UI. It is stupid how much easier Semantic UI makes HTML and CSS. That table took me hours to figure out padding adjustments over and over, only to look off when I switched over to a new computer. All that pain and effort gone, blown over in just a few words of ui, grid, and column. The entire top section of that web page had a title, navigation bar, and a rollover collage of pictures. That itself took me a month and a stylesheet that required a fast scrolling mouse just to reach the bottom. If someone told me that UI Frameworks existed, I would have screamed at them to tell me these things sooner.

Back then, I was really into web design. However, that one project curbed my interest. It didn’t stop me outright, but I learned about Adobe Dreamweaver and flash not long after completing that project. Eventually, I lost the will to get back into the HTML game.
