I never really thought of it until now, but coding standards are a bit like the accent of a language. This is not to be confused with character accents, but similar to an accent when speaking. When you learn a new language, you start by learning the formal way of speaking. After learning enough of the language, and depending on your surroundings, you start to accent the way you speak and in some respects writing. By throwing in a bit of slang, passive wording and nuances you get the same language that everyone can understand, it is just a nudge different. That is until the accent is so obscure that no one can understand it but it is still part of the language. 

Translating this into coding standards. Everyone, when they learn a programming language, start by learning the “formal” language. To the rest of us who know the language may go over the code and see a jumbled mess, and though some miracle the console prints out “Hello World.” Sure it's not elegant, however it is start. Hopefully, everyone will reach a point in their understanding of the programming language that they start to accent their code with coding standards. Like proper naming conventions, proper datatypes, extra variables, comments, spacing, newlines, etc. the list can go on. However eventually that jumbling mess from before eventually becomes an elegant code that flows when you trace it to a quirky minimalist program that you cannot help but smile at.
