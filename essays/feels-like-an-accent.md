I never really thought of it until now, but coding standards are a bit like a language’s accent. This is not to be confused with character accents, but similar to an accent when speaking. When you learn a new language, you start by learning the formal way of speaking. After learning enough of the language, and depending on your surroundings, you begin to accent the way you speak and, in some respects, write. By throwing in a bit of slang, passive wording, and nuances, you get the same language that everyone can understand; it is just a nudge different. Until the accent is so obscure that no one can understand it, but somehow still part of the same language.

Translating this into coding standards. Everyone, when they learn a programming language, start by learning the “formal” language. The rest of us who know the language may go over the code and see a jumbled mess, and through some miracle, the console prints out “Hello World.” Sure it’s not elegant; however, it is a start. Hopefully, everyone will reach a point in their understanding of the programming language that they start to accent their code. Like proper naming conventions, appropriate data types, unused variables, comments, spacing, newlines, etc., the list can go on. However, eventually, that jumbling mess from before will eventually become an elegant code that flows when you trace it or possibly a quirky minimalist program that you cannot help but smile at.

Coding Standards are just there as a template. It is so you and possibly the people around you can read and trace your code. On a professional level, it is to standardize the code template to make reading the code more straightforward and efficient. If a person not used to your set of coding standards looks through your code, I’m sure they would still be able to read your code, but they would just need some time to get adjusted to your standards. This could be said about accents as well. If a Southerner conversed with a Midwesterner, both should be able to understand each other. They both speak English. However, both accents have enough nuances in their way of speaking that some extra brainpower might be needed to comprehend each other.
